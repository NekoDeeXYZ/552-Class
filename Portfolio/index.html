            <h2>Aspirations of A Supportive Librarian </h2>
            <p> "Great Books help you understand, and they help you feel understood" -John Green</p>
            <p> My forever goal will always be to help as many people feel valued and heard. That they matter.</p>   
            <p> Professionally my currently goal is to provide the teens of my local community valuable experiences in building skills and relationships within the community. </p>
            <p>I also aspire to help the teens of the community realize that they too make an impact and a difference in the community around them. That they are seen and heard in my library.</p>
