                <h2> FAQ </h2>
                <h3> Q: What is GameTober?</h3>
                <p> Gametober is a weekly gaming challenge in october created to have gamers revisit horror games in thier library as well try out new ones! Participents are encouraged to share thier experieces using #GameTober2023 !</p>
                <h3> Q: What Inspired this?</h3>
                <p> Gametober was inspired by a whole mess of things. The general concept takes inspirartion from the artsy, <a href="https://inktober.com/"> InkTober Challenge </a> by Jake Park. Rather than a daily art prompt challengers have a weekly theme and a list of games to choose from. The idea to make this a horror based game challege is thanks to  <a href="contact.html"> GameHogg44 </a>, a close friend and streamer known for his fear of all things scary. </p>
                <h3>Q: What is the story behind GameTober? </h3>
                <p> The original idea for GameTober came about in January 2023 in a conversation on discord within my own gaming group. One of our friends, and coincidentally a small-time-streamer, had promised back in 2017 that they would play Alien Isolation and Dead Space on stream. A promise they never kept, but we contune to tease about. Together we all came up with an idea for our friend to stream horror games all october long, so we could forever have clips of him freaking out. While we teased and threw ideas around, nothing more came about this idea until a few months later. </p>
                <p> Speeding forward to August 2023, I was assigned to create a community website for a class in GradSchool. After a heavy round of failed ideas, I reached out to my friends, and they quickly reminded me of our idea from a few months back. But why stop at just making a goofy site for my friend? Instead I expanded and fleshed out the idea and thus GameTober was born!</p>
                <h3> Can I use the Gametober Challenge for my streams?</h3>
                <p> Of Course! Gametober is all about sharing what you play and revisiting old games. Be sure to toss in #GameTober2023, so others can also take part in the challenge.</p>
                <h3> Why is the minum 1 hour a week? Can I play more?</h3>
                <p> I set the challenge playtime super low, at an hour so that even the busiest of gamers can participate. This also means that if you bought the game to play, and really hated it you can still return it for the most part! By all means if you love the game or want to play more please do!</p>
                <h3> How can I play without buying a game?</h3>
                <p> Games are super expensive, so we made a few options for Players who are a bit strapped for cash. You can try out the Under $5 Challenge or even create your own challenge with games that you already own!</p>
